# A sample Makefile for building Google Test and using it in user
# tests.  Please tweak it to suit your environment and project.  You
# may want to move it to your project's root directory.
#
# SYNOPSIS:
#
#   make [all]  - makes everything.
#   make TARGET - makes the given target.
#   make clean  - removes all files generated by make.


# All tests produced by this Makefile.  Remember to add new tests you
# created to the list.
TESTS := sample1_unittest

# For each test xxx, create xxx_SRCS. Add gtest_main.a to use gtest's built in
# main function, or gtest.a to link in googletest but use your own main.
sample1_unittest_SRCS = sample1.cpp sample1_unittest.cpp gtest_main.a
